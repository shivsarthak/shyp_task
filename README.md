# Shyp Flutter App Readme

## Description

This Flutter project is designed to implement three screens that display details of ongoing and pending orders for a shipper subscribed to the Shyp platform. The three screens are as follows:
1. **Screen 1 (Orders) :** This screen displays the ongoing and pending loads for a specific user. It supports scrolling to accommodate multiple orders that do not fit on a single screen.
